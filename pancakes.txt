Ingredients:
Pancake Mix
High quality H20
Peanut Butter (I wouldn't recommend crunchy, but I won't judge.)
Syrup (none of that maple poppycock, either)

Directions:
Mix 2 cups pancake mix and 1.5 cups of water.  
Heat griddle to 350 degrees
Pour pancake mix onto griddle.  If you have a kid, make a Mickey Mouse face for bonus points.  Or if you are a kid.  Or both.
Let cook until the edges are dry, then flip and let cook 30 seconds.
Remove pancakes from griddle and smother in peanut butter
No really, put some more peanut butter on there
Pour some syrup on those bad boys.  Don't be shy.

STUFF YO FACE!
